  <p>The changing seasons bring new life
    Spring blossoms, summer sun, autumn's hue
    Winter's blanket, crisp and white
    Nature's cycle, ever true</p>

  <!--Ahnaf-->

    Nature's beauty never fades
    In fields and forests, mountains and glades
    From the tiniest flower to the tallest tree
    Nature's splendor is there for all to see
